### Machine Intelligence: Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning 

This repository houses some sections of the text and software associated with _Machine Intelligence: Applied Mathematics 
and Machine Learning_, a textbook I'm co-authoring with Professor Ruye Wang in the Harvey Mudd College Engineering department. 
A primary objective for the book is an emphasis on supporting the reader in a learning process that begins with mathematics, 
and culminates in practical experiences with the concepts and methods to do effective machine learning in an applied context. 

With this in mind, the repository will house a variety of software, primarily demos intended to give a learner the confidence 
and foundation to apply a particular method to explore their own data, and to aid a learner in exploring the
effect of designer-made choices (these choices are often encoded in so called 'hyperparameters'
in the machine learning community) on a method. 

#### Dependencies and Requirements

It is recommended to run mlam from a Python virtual environment. All dependencies can be downloaded by running 

```console 
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

from the project's root directory.
